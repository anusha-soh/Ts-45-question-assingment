//10.Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//This simple program tell us wether the number is Even or Odd.
let num: number = 6; // change value of num to test the program.
if (num %2 === 0) {  // conditional statements are used  
    console.log("This is an Even number."); // if codition is true
} else {
    console.log("This is a odd number"); // if condition is false,
};
